 - Building a Tic Tac Toe game
 - Rules:
 -     Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
 -     One player usually plays "X"s and the other player plays "O"s.
 -     In our version of the game, "X"s will always start.
 -     Players will alternate turns.
 -     The game will end when one of the conditions is true:
 -     1. A player gets three squares in a row
       2. A player gets three squares in a column
       3. A player gets three squares in either diagonal
       4. Every square is filled in, but no player has achieved conditions 1, 2, or 3 as described above --> A Draw!
